    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Serranilla Cay is a part of Serranilla bank, a former atoll that has since become a submerged reef with other uninhabited islets.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Geographic Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Coordinates: 15.50°N, 79.50°W<br/>
      Area: 460 mi² / 1,200 km²<br/>
      Elevation: Varies between right below/above sea level<br/>
      Island Type: Submerged carbonate platform
    </p>
    
    <h3>Species Observed</h3>
    <p>
      Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas),<br/>
      Loggerhead (Caretta caretta), &<br/>
      Hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata)
    </p>

    <h3>Ecological Importance/Environmental Features</h3>
    <p>
      Cayo Serranilla has a substantial amount of reef shelves which can help many invertebrates/vertebrates including sea turtles. This helps to sustain the early stages of life for these animals. This area is very remote and doesn't have much human disturbance which helps make it safe for sea turtles to feed in these areas during migration, and etc.

    <h3>Ecological Importance/Environmental Features</h3>
    <p>
      Bolivar has extremely healthy coral formations and clear waters. The reefs surrounding Cayo Bolivar act as rest and feeding areas for the sea turtles. The seagrass in that area as well help the adolescent sea turtles by giving them "shelter" to start developing.

    <h3>Ecological Importance/Environmental Features</h3>
    <p>
      Cayo Albuquerque has a very healthy and shallow reef that's located within the Seaflower Biosphere reserve. The coral and seagrass beds give safe habitats and feeding grounds for the adolescent hawksbills. With this being a marine protected area with a reduced amount of human disturbance, it makes it an essential place for nesting, migratory stop, and etc.
